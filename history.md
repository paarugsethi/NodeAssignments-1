## History of Javascript and Node

JavaScript is a programming language that was created at Netscape as a scripting tool to manipulate web pages inside their browser, Netscape Navigator.

Although it has been great for developing applications on the front-end, server-side Javascript wasn't very successful along with Netscape Livewire until 2009 when Node.js came around.

During that time, JavaScript had started to be considered as a more serious language, thanks to "Web 2.0" applications (such as Flickr, Gmail, etc.) that showed the world what a modern experience on the web could be like.

JavaScript engines also became considerably better as many browsers competed to offer users the best performance. Development teams behind major browsers worked hard to offer better support for JavaScript and find ways to make JavaScript run faster. The engine that Node.js uses under the hood, V8 (also known as Chrome V8 for being the open-source JavaScript engine of The Chromium Project), improved significantly due to this competition. Node.js introduces a lot of innovative thinking and approaches for JavaScript server-side development that have already helped many developers.
